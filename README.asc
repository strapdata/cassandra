= Strapdata fork of Apache Cassandra

This is repository contains a fork of Apache Cassandra ready to embed Elasticsearch indices, see https://github.com/strapdata/elassandra[Elassandra] project. 
For build and install instructions, see the official https://github.com/apache/cassandra[Apache Cassandra README]

****
Note for Windows users: to install Cassandra as a service, download
http://commons.apache.org/daemon/procrun.html[Procrun], set the
PRUNSRV environment variable to the full path of prunsrv (e.g.,
C:\procrun\prunsrv.exe), and run "bin\cassandra.bat install".
Similarly, "uninstall" will remove the service.
****

Now let's try to read and write some data using the Cassandra Query Language:

  $ bin/cqlsh

The command line client is interactive so if everything worked you should
be sitting in front of a prompt:

----
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9160.
[cqlsh 2.2.0 | Cassandra 1.2.0 | CQL spec 3.0.0 | Thrift protocol 19.35.0]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
----

As the banner says, you can use 'help;' or '?' to see what CQL has to
offer, and 'quit;' or 'exit;' when you've had enough fun. But lets try
something slightly more interesting:

----
cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE schema1
       WITH replication = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };
cqlsh> USE schema1;
cqlsh:Schema1> CREATE TABLE users (
                 user_id varchar PRIMARY KEY,
                 first varchar,
                 last varchar,
                 age int
               );
cqlsh:Schema1> INSERT INTO users (user_id, first, last, age)
               VALUES ('jsmith', 'John', 'Smith', 42);
cqlsh:Schema1> SELECT * FROM users;
 user_id | age | first | last
---------+-----+-------+-------
  jsmith |  42 |  john | smith
cqlsh:Schema1>
----

If your session looks similar to what's above, congrats, your single node
cluster is operational!

For more on what commands are supported by CQL, see
http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/[the CQL reference]. A
reasonable way to think of it is as, "SQL minus joins and subqueries, plus collections."
